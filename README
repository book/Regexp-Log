Regexp::Log
-----------

This module is intented to simplify the process of writing regular
expressions for parsing log files.

Wouldn't it be nice to be able to feed your Apache or Squid LogFormat
configuration string to a Perl object, put in the list of fields you
want to capture, and ask the object to give you the adequate regular
expression?

This module makes it possible.

You just have to write the adequate subclass, and put it on CPAN
for others to use.
